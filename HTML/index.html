                The summer was always great for Group 1, the otg Group. Warm days and fun smiles were always had, especially when ice cream was involved. Large scoop after large scoop, mothers everywhere had to be careful to not give in to their children's pleas for more. The best part of the summer ice cream was eating it faster than anyone else! The lazy breeze always picked up with the speed of the spoons, as they were joyfully delivering delicious dream scoops. It was the best!
                <br> However, as one naturally gets older, then somehow the body invented brainfreezes. To combat this, the otg Group invented quIck-bowls! Ready-made sundaes in on-the-go bowls. Eat anywhere, anytime, and never get a brainfreeze. There is a wide variety that surely the whole family will love. From the traditional banana split to new one such as Cookie Avalanche. Now found in stores near you.
